A simple system to generate, assign and track work orders to technicians. Work orders can only be generated by the Admin and then the assigned technician can view all orders, accept orders and then once complete they can then resolve the order. Orders have the date from when the customer contacted, when the order was created, when the order was accepted by the assigned technician and when the order was resolved.
